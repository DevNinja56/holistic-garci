      ## Flower


      Even with all of the wax, shatter, oil and other products on the market – yes, we have some good ones, too – there’s nothing more classic than flower. In case you’re picturing a tulip or a daffodil, we mean that furry, smelly stuff that makes you feel good.

      ## Cartridges


      When the art of growing quality flower meets the science of producing premium extracts, oil is one of the magical results. Strane’s 510 oil cartridges, with or without the battery, are all strain-specific and celebrate the essence of the plant itself.

      ## PAX Pods


      Because every detail matters to PAX and every flower matters to Strane, each PAX Era Pro pod is strain-specific. It’s made from pure, natural distillate that combines the gifts of mother nature (especially her tasty terpenes) with the advances of science.

      ## Concentrates


      For the veteran medical patients and experienced adult-use consumers out there, Strane concentrates are potent alternatives to flower. What starts with a seed, goes through the lab and ends up in a dab rig on a nightstand near you.
