  Thank you for shopping with Holistic Industries. As our name suggests, we care
  for the whole person, taking into consideration mental and social factors
  along with the physical symptoms of a disease or illness. We develop,
  cultivate and retail our products and third-party brand products (so defined
  below "Third Party Providers") through stores ("Retailers") with verified
  consumers ("Consumers").


  Our goal with this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we collect about you (also known as "User Data") and describe how we use that information to provide you and all of our users with safe and secure access to legal cannabis, industrial hemp-derived CBD, and other products and accessories. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://holisticindustries.com/terms-of-service), including any agreements incorporated by reference within the [Terms of Service (the "Holistic Terms")](https://holisticindustries.com/terms-of-service). Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning given to them in our [Terms of Service](https://holisticindustries.com/terms-of-service). If you do not feel comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy or our [Terms of Service](https://holisticindustries.com/terms-of-service), you should stop using or accessing the Holistic Services and terminate your Account. Certain parts of this Privacy Policy apply only to the Holistic Services as defined in the Terms; please see below for information specific to California Residents.


  ## INFORMATION WE COLLECT


  Please note, not all features are available in all locations, so some of the examples below may not apply to you.


  ## Information You Provide To Us


  We collect information about you when you provide it to us directly, when we request it from you, or when you give us permission to get it from a third party source. Below are some examples of the types of information we collect.


  ## Registration and Identity Verification


  When you visit Holistic's various websites, and its loyalty program ("Liberty Rewards") and other such affiliated websites, you give us your name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and, if necessary, a copy of your government-issued ID (i.e. your driver's license, state ID card, or passport). In order to receive a delivery or shipment, you must provide a valid delivery address - whether that's your home address or any other valid physical address. Additional information we receive from you may include, but is not limited to, a state-issued medical marijuana ID card or a physician's recommendation letter that you provide us in order to receive a medical delivery, or a selfie image to improve trust and safety while utilizing the Holistic Services.


  ## Demographic Information


  We also collect demographic information from you when you register, when you take our surveys, and throughout your use of the Holistic Services. Demographic information may include your age, gender, location, how you heard about Holistic, spending habits, consumption preferences, and other preferences or habits.


  ## Communications


  If you contact us directly, we may collect information from you that helps us provide a satisfying experience and answers any questions you have while using Holistic. For example, when you communicate with a member of our customer service team, we may ask you for your name, email address, delivery address, phone number, or proof of charge in order to identify your account, confirm your identity, or assist with your issue. If you send us an email, we will collect the contents of that email and any other information you choose to provide with your email. If you communicate with us via live chat, that correspondence will be archived. If you communicate with us via social media, we collect that communication and associate that information with your user account to the extent the information can be linked. Customer service communications over the phone may be recorded for quality control purposes and may be summarized within our customer support systems.


  ## Payment Information


  Payment information may be collected in connection with a transaction facilitated by Holistic. In some cases, for on-demand delivery, all payments are made to a licensed cannabis retail dispensary fulfilling your order, and not to Holistic. For other products and services, payments may be made directly to Holistic or another third party. In all cases, while we may retain a limited amount of payment information for identification and convenience, to keep your financial data secure, we do not store full payment or financial information on our servers. Unless otherwise noted, payment information flows through a third-party vendor who processes the payments for Retailers and Holistic.


  ## Voluntary User Surveys


  From time to time, we may invite you to fill out voluntary user surveys or to participate in focus groups to provide feedback on various topics, which may include, without limitation: your experiences with Holistic and/or our partners, your experience with the Holistic Services, available products, new services, your preferences related to cannabis, and your sentiments on public policy or other cannabis industry topics. These surveys are often conducted by Holistic or third-party market research firms, who collect such data on our behalf, to analyze industry preferences and trends. Holistic does not share your survey information on an individualized basis, and does not share this data for direct marketing to its users.


  ## Applicant Data


  When you apply to a job or an accelerator program with Holistic or one of its licensed retailers, you may provide us with information about you to help us determine whether you are a good candidate for the role you are applying for. Such information may include your name, phone number, email, resume/CV, availability, references, and more.


  ## Information We Collect When You Use Holistic

  We collect your location information when you provide us with a delivery address or we may use geolocation-based services in order to verify your location. For instance, knowing your location may be necessary to allow you full access to our mobile applications or certain aspects of the Holistic Services. Furthermore, for compliance reasons, some of the Holistic Services may be restricted depending on where you are located. Collecting your location information is also necessary to connect you to a licensed retailer that services your delivery area, to send you relevant content based on your location, and to optimize or improve our products and services.

  ## Cookies and Technical Information


  We also collect information through the use of "cookies," tracking pixels, and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files created by websites and stored on your device.

  ## Call and Text Information


  We work with third-party partners to facilitate phone calls and text messages, including communications between you and your driver. We collect information about such communications, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties' phone numbers, and the content of any SMS messages. This helps us provide and optimize our services and the Holistic Services.


  ## User Feedback


  We want to make sure you have a consistently positive experience with the Holistic Services, and we are always looking to improve our products and services. Accordingly, we collect and retain information about any ratings, reviews, and feedback you provide about our service, the Holistic Services, the products on our site, licensed retailers, and any delivery services.
