      - faqcontenttitle: How long does a PAX Pod last?
        faqcontentbody: PAX Pod longevity is different for everyone. In our experience,
          PAX Pods can last as long as two weeks if used moderately and on a
          medium temperature. If used less often, it can be used for three to
          four weeks. If the Pods are used heavily and at high temperature, they
          tend to last for a few days at the very least. That being said, each
          experience is unique. Please contact us by email at
          hi@thisisstrane.com if you have any concerns about the life of your
          Pod.
      - faqcontenttitle: What temperature should I use for my PAX Pod?
        faqcontentbody: We recommend keeping your PAX Pod around 500-620 degrees.
          Keeping it at a low-medium temperature brings out the natural flavors
          with each hit, and can also extend the life of your Pod. If you have a
          PAX Era Pro, you can actually see our recommended temperature settings
          for each Pod through the [PAX App](https://web-app.pax.com/)!

        faqcontentbody: We recommend reaching out to us via email at hi@thisisstrane.com
          and a member of our team should be able to assist you.
      - faqcontenttitle: The product I purchased wasn’t up to my standards/I didn’t like
          it, do you do refunds?
        faqcontentbody: We’re sorry to hear about your issue with our product. The
          dispensary where you purchased it has the ability to exchange the
          product or issue a credit in certain circumstances. Please reach out
          to them and someone from the dispensary team should be able to assist
          you.
      - faqcontenttitle: The airflow of my PAX Pod is stuck and I can't pull anything
          through, what's happening?
        faqcontentbody: Sometimes PAX Pods can clog up. We see this happen more in
          colder weather when the Pods tend to be a bit colder on shelves. In
          some cases, this can be remedied by submerging the Pod in some warm
          (NOT hot!) water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Make sure you seal
          the Pod in a ziplock bag first, ensuring no water can get inside the
          bag. This helps loosen up the oil and can sometimes result in your Pod
          clearing up. If you still can't pull anything through, please contact
          the dispensary where you purchased it and they will work with our team
          to issue a replacement.
      - faqcontenttitle: Why does my PAX Pod leak?
        faqcontentbody: PAX Pods are actually leak-resistant, but if you do notice
          leaking please check for any broken/cracked/missing parts on your Pod
          that could cause a leak. The Pod may also have been over-filled at the
          lab, which in some cases can cause oil to leak out of the top. If any
          of these problems arise, please contact the dispensary where you
          purchased it and they will work with our team to issue you a
          replacement Pod.
      - faqcontenttitle: Why is my PAX Pod half empty?
        faqcontentbody: Sometimes this appears to happen when a PAX Pod will be stored
          on its side. Please place it right-side up and wait 30 minutes to an
          hour for the oil to situate itself. If the problem continues, please
          reach out to your local dispensary and someone there should be able to
          assist you.
      - faqcontenttitle: My PAX Pod doesn’t produce any (or very little) vapor, can I
          get a new one?
        faqcontentbody: We’re sorry to hear about your issue with our product! The
          dispensary where you purchased it has the ability to exchange the
          product or issue a credit in certain circumstances. Please reach out
          to the dispensary and someone there should be able to assist you.
