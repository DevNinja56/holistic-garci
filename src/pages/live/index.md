  livetopcontent: Strane LIVE makes good on the promise of its name. Live extracts
    become premium, terpene-forward products for consumers who know the
    difference. What’s so special about Strane LIVE vapes and concentrates? Here
    are some of the many HIGH-lights.
livepagesliderheading: WHY STRANE LIVE?

      alt: Super fresh
    livepageslidercontent: For all Live products, premium flower is fresh-frozen
      before and during the extraction process, as opposed to dried and cured.
      This process happens in a lab, but it’s all about keeping the plant as
      nature intended.

      alt: Extra tasty
    livepageslidercontent: The main difference with Live products is the heightened
      terpene profile. Freezing the flower means that its full taste and aroma
      are fully intact. Want lemon? Get a burst of it. Want pine? Let it waft in
      the air.

      alt: Full effect
    livepageslidercontent: Most importantly, consumers turn to Live products because
      they typically feel the effects of the product (and plant) more fully.
      Terpenes interact with THC, CBD and other cannabinoids in what’s called
      the “Entourage Effect.”

      ### STRANE LIVE


      ## Cartridges


      If you’re new to the world of live resin oil…congratulations, you’ve arrived. Each one is made from freshly harvested flower that’s frozen before and during the extraction process. Strane LIVE’s 510 Cartridges are more terpene-forward than their cured counterparts. But you can’t go wrong either way.

      ## PAX Pods


      It’s hard to improve upon a Strane PAX Pod, and we’re not here to play favorites. Strane LIVE PAX Pods are even more complete, considered full-spectrum extracts that haven’t been dried or cured. A freezing process preserves the best of each bud – and, most importantly, how you experience it.

  ### THE SHINE OF DIAMONDS


  THIS IS what diamonds feel like. Move over, Tiffany. No matter how many carats you pack into a princess cut, it can’t compare to a little jar with a lot of THC. Strane Diamonds are for cannaseurs who are ready for something special. They’re LIMITED EDITION, so there’s no lifelong commitment. But they do have the medical benefits to be with you in sickness and in health. In fact, they’re over 95% THC, and they’re made from premium flower for premium relief.
