      ## The PAX Era Pro


      The all-new PAX Era Pro took one of our favorite devices and made it even better, with more predictability, control, and potency than ever before. Equal parts style and science, it’s a cannabis oil vaporizer featuring a discreet design and ideal hand feel. A pleasure to use in the moment, and especially in the moments that follow.
